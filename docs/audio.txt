The HDAudio driver was tested on Dell Inspiron 5559 and Eee PC 1001PX.

; FEATURES
;	- Uses the first codec found
;	- Output only
;	- Short list-entries only (parsing 2 DWORDS, i.e. max 8 ConnListEntries for a node)
;	- (Range)	Not implemented yet
;	- Sets volume to medium (gain = 0x3F) (0x7F is the maximum)
;	- I couldn't test the Knob-widget 

The assembly-code (pci_init_hdaudio) tries to:
- enable bus-master and memory-space and IRQs 
- select HDA if HDA and AC97 are shared
- save BAR
- clear TCSEL
It sets HDAudio-detected to true, if it succeeds.

If right after boot, "Audio: HD Audio" is shown, then we can load and use the HDAudio-driver (fthsrc/drivers/hdaudio.txt)

AUCODECSINFO prints data about codec, widgets (e.g. widget-capabilities), 
it can be executed right after boot, if HDAUDIO was successfully detected.

AUINFO prints the values of the registers and the DMA-positions. 
It is useful to see if the DMA-engines are looping or not (constantly changing value in case of every AUINFO).
This is true, if we execute AUINFO during audio-play.
Note that only the input and four output positions get printed, so if there are 7 input-streams and 9 output streams, then 
the 8th one will show the DMA-position of the first output-stream.
If there are 4 input-streams and 4 output-streams then the 5th value will be the first output-stream's.

; How to use:
LUSB . 
USBENUM .     ( in my case, the device-address of the pendrive is 2)
2 USBFSINIT . . . .
( FALSE USBFSLS .)
HEX
20000000 USBFSREAD hdaudio.txt" . .  ( prints size)
20020000 USBFSREAD NINA.WAV" . .
FORGET USB
20000000 size LOADM 
AUINIT .      ( we need to call it just once, right after boot, if HDAudio was detected; it returns zero, if fails)
( FALSE USBFSLS .)
HEX
( 3F AUSETVOL)                    ( 3F is set by default in hdaudio.txt)
AUIRQON 
20020000 AUWAV .
AUIRQOFF                          ( After the music has been played, we stop IRQs by AUIRQOFF)
FORGET HDAUDIO
