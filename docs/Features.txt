zzzFORTH (also called ZFOS) Written in 32-bit Intel-assembly and FORTH
The best FORTH tutorial is "Starting FORTH by Leo Brodie":

- Resolutions: 1024*768*16 or 640*480*16 (for Eee PC) 
- Multitasking (but only one core or CPU is used)
- Can boot from Floppy/HD/USB-MSD
In FORTH (in ZFOS/fthsrc/):
- IDE hard disk driver
- USB(EHCI, XHCI) driver (can read files from pendrives formatted to FAT32) 
- HDAUDIO driver (very limited)
- BLOCK
- HEXVW, HEXED
- TXTVW, TXTED
- SIN, COS, TAN, SQRT (fixed point math)
- LINE, POLYGON(can be filled), CIRCLE(can be filled), PAINT
- Sutherland-Cohen line-clipping 
- Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping
- BEZIERQ, BEZIERC
- Scrolling of the content of rectangular areas
- QOI image format (decode/encode) supported
- 3D (fixed point math) (e.g. rotating cubes)
- Astronomical algorithms (fixed point decimal)

See ZFOS/docs for details

The original assembly code of the drivers (IDE, HDAUDIO and USB(XHCI, EHCI)) are available in the ASM folder.
